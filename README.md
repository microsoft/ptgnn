# ptgnn: A PyTorch GNN Library ![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/ptgnn?style=flat-square)

This is a library containing pyTorch code for creating graph neural network (GNN) models.
The library provides some sample implementations.

If you are interested in using this library, please read about its [architecture](docs/architecture.md)
and [how to define GNN models](docs/gnns.md) or follow [this tutorial](docs/tutorial.md).

Note that `ptgnn` takes care of defining the whole pipeline, including data wrangling tasks, such
as data loading and tensorization. It also defines PyTorch `nn.Module`s for
the neural network operations. These are independent of the
`AbstractNeuralModel`s and can be used as all other PyTorch's `nn.Module`s,
if one wishes to do so.

The library is mainly engineered to be fast for sparse graphs. For example, for the
Graph2Class task (discussed below) on a V100 with the default hyperparameters and architecture
`ptgnn` can process about 82 graphs/sec (209k nodes/sec and 1,129k edges/sec) during training
and about 200 graph/sec (470k nodes/sec and 2,527k edges/sec) during testing.

#### Implemented Tasks
All task implementations can be found in the [`ptgnn.implementations`](ptgnn/implementations) package.
Detailed instructions on the data and the training steps can be found [here](/docs/implementations.md).
We welcome external contributions. The following GNN-based tasks are implemented:

* **PPI** The PPI task as described by
[Zitnik and Leskovec, 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.04638).
* **VarMisuse** This is a re-implementation of the VariableMisuse task of
    [Allamanis _et al._, 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00740).
* **Graph2Sequence** This is re-implementation of the GNN->GRU model of
                     [Fernandes _et. al._, 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01824).
* **Graph2Class** Classify (Label) a subset of the input nodes into classes
                    similar to Graph2Class in [Typilus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10657).


The [tutorial](docs/tutorial.md) gives a step-by-step example for coding the Graph2Class model.


### Installation

This code was tested with PyTorch 1.4 and depends
on [`pytorch-scatter`](https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_scatter).
Please install the appropriate versions of these libraries based
on your CUDA setup following their instructions. (Note
that the `pytorch-scatter` binaries built for CUDA 10.1 also work for
CUDA 10.2).

1. To install PyTorch 1.7.0 or higher, use the up-to-date command from [PyTorch Get Started](https://pytorch.org/get-started/), selecting the appropriate options, e.g. for Linux, pip, and CUDA 10.1 it's currently:
    ```bash
    pip install torch torchvision
    ```

1. To install `pytorch-scatter`, follow the instructions from the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_scatter), choosing the appropriate CUDA option, _e.g._, for PyTorch 1.7.0 and CUDA 10.1:
    ```bash
    pip install torch-scatter==2.0.5+cu101 -f https://pytorch-geometric.com/whl/torch-1.7.0.html
    ```

1. To install `ptgnn` from pypi, including all other dependencies:
    ```bash
   pip install ptgnn
    ```
   If you want to use ptgnn sampels with Azure ML (e.g. the `--aml` flag in the implementation CLIs), install with
   ```bash
    pip install ptgnn[aml]
    ```
   or directly from the sources, `cd` into the root directory of the project and run
    ```bash
    pip install -e .
    ```
    To check that installation was successful and run the unit tests:
    ```python
    python setup.py test
    ```
